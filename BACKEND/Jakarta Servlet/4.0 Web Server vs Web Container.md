1. Web Server 
	- static content - html, css, js, images, pdf etc (static content)
	- content doesnt changes
	- web server doesnt process the file while serving
	- doent serve dynamic content 
	- eg. Apache, IIS

2. Web Container 
	- to serve dynamic content
	- by dynamic content mean is if the page refreshed and same data is loaded in index.html it is static but if the data is changing then it is dynamic content hence we can say in angular the static data is served
	- what kind of technology used to serve dynamic content - Servlet and jsp 
	- eg. Tomcat, GlassFish

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">When you make an API call from a browser to a Spring Boot application, the application typically includes both a **web server** and a **web container**. Here's how the flow of data works and how these components interact:</mark>

### Components Involved:
1. **Web Server**: The web server (e.g., embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) is responsible for handling HTTP requests from clients, such as a web browser or other HTTP client. It listens on a specific port (like 8080) for incoming requests.

2. **Web Container**: The web container (also known as a servlet container) is part of the web server that handles the execution of servlets, which are Java classes that process HTTP requests and generate responses. In a Spring Boot application, the web container manages the lifecycle of servlets and interacts with Spring's DispatcherServlet, which is central to handling web requests.

### Flow of Data:
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the data flow when an API call is made to a Spring Boot application:

1. **Client Request**: A client (e.g., a web browser, Postman, or another HTTP client) makes an HTTP request to the Spring Boot application. This request is typically sent to a specific URL (like `http://localhost:8080/api/resource`).

2. **Web Server Receives Request**: The web server (e.g., embedded Tomcat) receives the incoming HTTP request. Since the web server is always listening on the specified port (like 8080), it’s the first component to interact with the client request.

3. **Routing to Web Container**: The web server forwards the request to the web container, which is part of the web server itself. The web container is responsible for handling servlet-based requests.

4. **DispatcherServlet**: Within the Spring Boot application, the web container routes the request to Spring's `DispatcherServlet`. The `DispatcherServlet` is the core of Spring's web framework and acts as the front controller. It’s responsible for:
   - **Mapping the Request**: Determining which controller method should handle the request, based on the request URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and any other relevant criteria.
   - **Processing the Request**: The mapped controller method processes the request, often involving business logic, database interactions, and/or calling other services.
   - **Generating a Response**: The controller method typically returns a response object (e.g., a JSON object) that the `DispatcherServlet` converts into an appropriate HTTP response.

5. **Response Handling**: After processing, the `DispatcherServlet` sends the response back to the web container.

6. **Web Server Sends Response**: The web container hands the response back to the web server, which then sends the HTTP response back to the client (e.g., the browser).

7. **Client Receives Response**: The client receives the HTTP response, which could include data (like JSON), status codes, and headers. The browser or client application then processes this response, which might involve rendering the data on the UI or further processing.

### Summary of the Flow:
- The **web server** handles the initial receiving and final sending of HTTP requests and responses.
- The **web container** manages the actual processing of the request within the application, leveraging servlets and, more specifically, Spring’s `DispatcherServlet`.
- The **DispatcherServlet** is key in routing the request to the appropriate controller, executing business logic, and preparing the response.

So yes, when you do an API call to a Spring Boot application, both the web server and web container are involved in handling that request. The web server is responsible for network communication, while the web container is responsible for request processing and routing within the application.
