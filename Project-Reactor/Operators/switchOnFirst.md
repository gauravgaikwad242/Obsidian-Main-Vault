- if the condition is not satisfied we can change the entire publisher and replace it with something else publisher
**Operator: `switchOnFirst`**

- **Description:**
  - The `switchOnFirst` operator is used in Project Reactor for Java.
  - It provides access to the first emitted element of a Flux along with a Signal, which represents the type of event (onNext, onComplete, or onError).

- **Syntax:**
  ```java
  Flux.switchOnFirst(BiFunction<Signal<T>, Flux<T>, Publisher<? extends R>> transformer)
  ```

- **Parameters:**
  - `transformer`: A function that takes a Signal and a Flux, and returns a Publisher.

- **Usage:**
  - The `transformer` function allows you to conditionally transform or switch the Flux based on the first emitted element or Signal.

- **Example:**

  ```java
  Flux<Integer> sourceFlux = Flux.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

  sourceFlux
      .switchOnFirst((signal, flux) -> {
          if (signal.isOnNext() && signal.get() > 3) {
              return Flux.just(10, 20, 30); // Switch to a new Flux emitting 10, 20, 30
          } else {
              return flux; // Continue with the original source Flux
          }
      })
      .subscribe(value -> System.out.println("Received: " + value));
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - In the example, the `switchOnFirst` operator is applied to `sourceFlux`.
  - It takes a function that checks the first emitted element. If it's an onNext signal and the value is greater than 3, it switches to a new Flux emitting 10, 20, and 30; otherwise, it continues with the original source Flux.

- **Output:**
  ```
  Received: 1
  Received: 2
  Received: 3
  Switched to a new Flux
  ```
  
- **Note:**
  - `switchOnFirst` provides a powerful way to dynamically alter the behavior of a Flux based on the first emitted element, allowing for conditional transformations or switches to alternative sources.
