- without selector

lifecycle 

--------- start ---------------
app starts ->
	get Initial state (with selector) -> 
		in runtime update the state -> 
			for updating state dispatch an action -> 
				this action will be linked to the reducer -> 
					reducer will change the data in store i.e. update state -> 
						this state will be subscribed by the subscriber with selector 

-------- end ---------------

1. in module for store
here counter is the key  with which the state can be accessed and can be used as selector
```ts 
  imports: [BrowserModule, StoreModule.forRoot({
    //def: store where the data is stored
    //here : we can add data with reducer
    //here : key can be anyting //counter
    //1.1
    counter: counterReducer,
    //authkey: authReducer
  }, {})],
```

1. create reducer 
```ts 
import { createReducer, on } from "@ngrx/store";
import { increment } from "./counter.actions";
const initialState = 3;
//createReducer() is internal function 1.0
//def: reducer : contains logic for changing state of app, eg incremetn by 1 
export const counterReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  //whenever increment action is executed the callback function is run
  //on() function is used to listen to the action
  //action paramete is used to get data passed from action
  on(increment, (state,action)=> {
    // action.
    return state + action.value;
  }));
```

2. creating action
- here '[Counter] Increment' is the datatype or type of the action 
```ts 
import { createAction, props } from "@ngrx/store";

//3.1 def action : will execute the reducer
export const increment = createAction(
  '[Counter] Increment', //standard way,
  props<{value: number}>() //for attaching data to action
  // props<{email: number,passowrd:String}>() //for attaching data to action
);
```

3. dispatching the action 
- inject store dependency from ngrx

```ts 
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { increment } from '../store/counter.actions';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-counter-controls',
  templateUrl: './counter-controls.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./counter-controls.component.css'],
})
export class CounterControlsComponent {
  constructor(private store: Store) {}

  increment() {
    this.store.dispatch(increment({value: 2}))
  }
```


4. subscribing to the state 
```ts 

@Component({
  selector: 'app-counter-output',
  templateUrl: './counter-output.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./counter-output.component.css'],
})
export class CounterOutputComponent {
  count$: Observable<number>;

  //2.1
  constructor(private store: Store<{counter:number}>) {
    this.count$ = this.store.select('counter')
  }
}
```
