- **Introduction:** The `distinctUntilChanged` operator in RxJS is a powerful tool for filtering out consecutive duplicate values in an observable stream. 
- It helps ensure that only distinct, non-repeating values are emitted, making it useful for scenarios where you want to react to changes in data without being overwhelmed by repeated identical values.
- **How it Works:** The `distinctUntilChanged` operator compares each emitted value with the previously emitted value. If the current value is the same as the previous one, it's filtered out and not emitted. Only when a new, distinct value is encountered will it be emitted.

```
this.searchGroup
    .get('distinctUntilChangedDemo')?.valueChanges
    .pipe(
      debounceTime(300), //stops the data from going ahead for a time limit check console and type in input box
      distinctUntilChanged()
      )
    .subscribe(data=>{
      console.log(`%c search string :${data}`,"color:orange")
      this.distinctUntilChangedI = data;
    })
```


- `distinctUntilChanged` filters out consecutive duplicates.
- Emits only when the current value is distinct from the previous one.
- Import the operator from the RxJS library.
- Use the `pipe` method to apply the operator to an observable stream.
- Useful for user input handling and real-time data streams.
- Helps reduce noise and focus on significant data changes.
