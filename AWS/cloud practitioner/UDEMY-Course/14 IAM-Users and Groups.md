### IAM - Identity and Access Management 
Root User - default and not to be shared 
Users - we can create users 
Groups - contain only user not group 
Users don't have to belong to any group 


### Why groups and users 
- to give authorization to the users 
### IAM : Permissions 
- User and groups have assigned JSON doc called policies
