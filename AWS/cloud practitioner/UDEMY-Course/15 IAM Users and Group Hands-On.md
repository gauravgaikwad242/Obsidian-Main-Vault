### Creating Admin User 
 go to iam -> users -> create users 

1. create user with req details 
2. give permission - admin - added to admin group 
3. tag - metadata to user

For user to login to account an unique url is given 
we can create a unique url as we want

we can use private window for multi session login for multiple users 

- go to aws 
- sign in as iam user 
- put in alias we added for unique url or account id 
- and password 
we can see on top right the login info as IAM user , else it is root user
