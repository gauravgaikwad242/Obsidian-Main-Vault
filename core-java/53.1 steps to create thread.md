1. write a class that extends Thread class or extends Runnable interface this is available lang package 
2. write public void run() method in that class. this is the method by default executed by any method 
3. create an object to that class (in main())
4. start running the thread 

```java 
package package1;
class Multitask extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("thread running");
    }
}
public class ClassA {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Multitask aobj = new Multitask();
        Thread thread = new Thread(aobj);
        thread.run();
    }
}


```

```java 
package package1;

class Multitask extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("thread running");
    }
}

public class ClassA {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Thread thread = new Multitask();
    thread.run();
}
}

```
