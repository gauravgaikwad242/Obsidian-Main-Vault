##### *In a java program if we don't write any Constructor then the compiler will be by default providing  a non-Parameterized Constructor*

so now there are two types of constructor
1. Parameterized Constructor
2. Default Constructor

##### *If we create any type of constructor compiler will not provide and default constructor*

#### Constructor

1. constructor name should be as Class Name
2. Constructor should not have any return type
3. *we need to initialize a class Object with the available constructors present in our program*
4.  *In a Java Program if we are not writing any constructors that is either Parameterized Constructor or Non-Parameterized constructor then java compiler is going to provide our program with a default constructor*
5. *Default constructor is same like Non-Parameterized*
	1. default constructor -----------> Provided by the compiler
	2. Non-Parameterized constructor -------------> provided by the programmer 
6. <strong>The access Modifiers for the default constructor provided by the compiler will be same as the access Modifiers of Class (if the class is public then Constructor is also public OR if the class is default then constructor is also default</strong>
7. If we declare a constructor as private then we can restrict the object creation of our class in other classes 
8. Just like void methods inside a constructor also <u>we can write a return a statement without returning anything</u> 
9.  <span style="color:green">Constructor Overloading is Possible</span>.   ---   <span style="color:red">Constructor Overriding is NOT Possible </span>.  

```java 
public class ClassA {
    void meth1() {
        System.out.println("Meth1( ) called ");
        return;
    }
    void meth2() {
        System.out.println("Meth2() called");
    }
    private ClassA() {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        return;
    }
    private ClassA(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}
class ClassB {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassA aobj1 = new ClassA(); // error as constructor is private
        ClassA aobj2 = new ClassA("Java is awesome"); // error as constructor is private

        aobj1.meth1();
        aobj2.meth2();
    }
}
```

#### Difference between a Method and a Constructor

|method|constructor|
|---|---|
|has return type|doesnt have return type|
|name cannot be same as class name | name should be same as class name|
|we have to call it manually |by default it is called at the time of object creation|
|can be overridden | cannot be overridden|
|syntax |syntax|
|can return a value| cannot return a value|
