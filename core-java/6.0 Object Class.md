#Inheritance
- Inheritance means acquiring the properties of one class into another class.
- with the child class object we can access parent class methods

### Object Class 
- object class acts as parent class to all the classes by default
- hence we can access hashCode method in all class 
- Object class present in java.lang class 
- 11 methods are there in object class 

#interview

1. Object class is present in java.lang package 
2. In every java program by default java.lang package will be automatically imported 
3. Object class is the first class in the java class hierarchy 
4. Object class acts as a parent class for all the java classes (either predefined or Userdefined class )
5. As Object class is present in java.lang package no need to `import` 
6. Object class has 11 important methods which we access them with every other class object.

|protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException|creates exact copy of the object|
|public String toString() |Returns a string representing of the object|
|public final Class getClass()|Returns present class reference|
|public final void notify()|All these methods are used in java multithreading <br> which plays crucial role in synchronization|
|public final void notifyAll()|--|
|public final void wait()|--|
