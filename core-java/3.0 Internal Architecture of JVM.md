- Internal Architecture of JVM 
1. Class Loader 
2. 5 Memory Area
	1. Class Area
	2. Heap Area
	3. Stack Area 
	4. PC-Registers
	5. Native Method Stack
3. Execution Engine 
	1. Interpreter 
	2. Garbage Collector

a. Class Loader 
	Note - *not present in JVM but above the JVM*
	- from class loader the .class file will be coming into JVM
	it does three things 
		1. Loading - it will load .class file into memory
		2. Linking - the linking between both the classes is done, linking of dependencies
		3. Initialization - for static the memory will be assigned when the static variable are initialize .static variable will be initialize at the time of loading not at the time of running

b. Memory Area 
1. Class Area - It stores the metadata (data about the data) information of the class.
2. Heap Area - Every class object we create in code will be stored inside heap area.
		1. it stores all the class object which we are creating
		2. inside #heap area there is one more special memory know as <strong>SCP</strong> (<strong>String Constant Pool</strong>) which is allocated to store only String class Object
3. Stack Area - 
	- *whenever we are running a java method it needs some temporary memory to store its data and results that memory will be allocated inside stack area*
	- in the following code 10 will be stored in a , but (a+b) will be stored in some temp area which is stack area, 
	- the temporary memory which is needed by method is stack area 
```java 
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        int c = 20+(a+b);
```
4. PC-Registers - Program Counter Registers 
- it stores LOG file of Thread Executions.
- at a time which thread is running these logs are stored into pc-reg

5. Native Method Stack 
- The methods which are not written in JAVA, but those are used in java are known as Native Methods.
- these methods are present in a special memory which is known as Native method Stack

<hr> 

c. Execution Engine 
1. Interpreter
	- Java Interpreter will convert the byte code instructions which are present in the .class file into the machine understandable code 
	byteCode ----- convert -----> machine understandable code

2. Garbage Collector
- Garbage Collector is going to destroy all unused or unreferenced objects from the #heap area. 
- Process of Reaquiring the heap space by destroying unused and unreferenced objects from heap area.
