break : it will stop the loop execution

continue : continue will not break the loop but the statements after the continue statements will not be getting executed for that loop only 

- Java jump statements enable transfer of control to other parts of program 
- java provides three jump statements 
 1. break 
 2. continue
 3. return 
- in addition 

```java 
for (int i =i; i<=0 ; i++) {
if (i == 5) {
//break;
//continue;
//return;
}
}
```
