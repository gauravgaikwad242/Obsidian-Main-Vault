### Returning a Value from a Java Method 
1. When a compiler will be coming back to the calling method?
- a compiler will be coming back to the calling method in following scenario
	1. After executing all the statements present inside a method
	2. whenever compiler comes across the `return statement`
	3. in case of Exception 
- key-point 
	1. void methods does not need return statement 
	2. except void methods all other methods 100% need return statement otherwise we will be getting an compile time error 
	3. *return type of method and return value of a method should be COMPATIBLE*
		1. compatible because a method with int return type can return 'A' as char because it will return ascii value 
	4. Return statement may not be the Last statement inside a method but it is last executable statement 
		1. e.g.. in case of if else condition the return statement is in both if and else so int this case it is not last statement
	5. it is not mandatory to write a return statement inside a void methods, But if we want to write a return statement inside a void method we can do that without returning anything
