```java 
ClassA aobj = new ClassA();
Thread thread = new Thread(aobj);
thread.start();
```
#### A new thread is created and that new thread is responsible for running the run() present in classA as we are overriding the run method which is present in Thread class 

```java 
thread.run()
```

#### no new thread will be created when we are calling run() method. it will be executed just like normal method. but classA run method will be called as we are doing method overriding 

```java 
Thread t1 = new Thread()
t1.start();
```

#### new thread will be created when we call start() the run method called is from thread class. that new thread is responsible for running the run method

```java 
t1.run();
```
#### no new thread will be created when we call run() method . the run method called is from Thread class .
