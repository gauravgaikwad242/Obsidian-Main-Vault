1. static is mainly used for memory management
2. we can use static in three ways 

| static |.|.|
|----|----|----|
| Variable |Method | Block |

3. a variable which is declared as static and it is present inside a class and outside any method block or a constructor is know as static variable 
4. we can access a static variable in three ways
	1. by using identifier name
	2. by using class object a
	3. and directly by using <u>Class Name</u>
5. for static variables jvm will automatically initialize them with their default values 
6. <u style="color: red">for final static variable jvm will not initialize them with their default values , it is the responsibility of the programmer</u> 
7. there will be only one copy of static variable available throughout the program
8. static variables are not constants we can change the value of a static variable (once we have changed the value of a static variable the updated value will be reflected to the entire program )
9. <u style="color: red">static variables will be initialized at the time of class loading (by class loader) </u> 
10. A static variable can never be a local variable 

### static Method 
1. a method which is declared as static is known as static method. 
2. we can access a static method in 3 ways
	1. identifier name
	2. class object 
	3. <u style="color : red">class name</u> 


#interview 
can we access non-static variable in static method?
ans : not with identifier name
	  : with only class object we can access else we cannot .

```java 
public class ClassA {
    int x = 100; // Instance or non-static or Global Variable
    static int y = 200; // static or class Variable

    void meth1() { // non-static / normal /concrete method
        System.out.println("meth1() called ");
        System.out.println("instance variable : " + x);
        System.out.println("static variable : " + y);
    }

    static void meth2() // static method
    {
        System.out.println("meth2() called");
        System.out.println("instatnce variable : " + new ClassA().x);
        System.out.println("static variable : " + y);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        meth1(); // C.E. BECAUSE we are calling by using identifier name [this keywork to be discussed later ]
        new ClassA().meth1(); // by using class object
        ClassA.meth1(); // C.E. BECUASE we are calling using class name

        System.out.println("------------------------");

        meth2(); // by using identifier name
        new ClassA().meth2(); // by using class name
        ClassA.meth2(); // by using className
    }
}
```
