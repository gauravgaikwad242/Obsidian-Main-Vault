1. static is mainly used for memory management
2. we can use static in three ways 

| static |.|.|
|----|----|----|
| Variable |Method | Block |

3. a variable which is declared as static and it is present inside a class and outside any method block or a constructor is know as static variable 
4. we can access a static variable in three ways
	1. by using identifier name
	2. by using class object a
	3. and directly by using <u>Class Name</u>
5. for static variables jvm will automatically initialize them with their default values 
6. <u style="color: red">for final static variable jvm will not initialize them with their default values , it is the responsibility of the programmer</u> 
7. there will be only one copy of static variable available throughout the program
8. static variables are not constants we can change the value of a static variable (once we have changed the value of a static variable the updated value will be reflected to the entire program )
9. <u style="color: red">static variables will be initialized at the time of class loading (by class loader) </u> 
10. A static variable can never be a local variable
