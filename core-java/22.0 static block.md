1. In our java program if we are having a main method and a static block the first priority will be given to static block.
2. we can write any no of static blocks in our program 
3. we cannot call static blocks, they will be getting executed in the defined order ( that is top to bottom)
4. <u>before java 1.5 version we can run a java program only with the help of static block</u>, but after that it is mandatory to write main method in our program to run the java application.
5. final static variables, we are supposed to initialize them at time of its declaration or only inside a static block . anywhere else if we are trying to initialize a final static variable except inside a static block or at the time of its declaration we will be getting an compile time error.  

```java 
public class ClassA {
    final static int x;

    static void meth1() {
        System.out.println("meth1() called ");
        // x = 100; C.E. because we cannot initialize a final static variable inside a
        // method
        System.out.println("x value : " + x);
    }

    static {
        x = 100;
        System.out.println("1st static block called ");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("class A main() called");
        ClassA.meth1();
    }

    static {
        // x = 9; C.E. because final variables are constants
        System.out.println("2nd static block called");
    }
}
```

6. static variable and static block will be having equal priorities. 
 case 1). static variable - main() -----> static variable
 case 2). static block - main() --------> static block 
 case 3). static block - main() - static variable ----->  static variable- static block - main()
