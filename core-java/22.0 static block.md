1. In our java program if we are having a main method and a static block the first priority will be given to static block.
2. we can write any no of static blocks in our program 
3. we cannot call static blocks, they will be getting executed in the defined order ( that is top to bottom)
4. <u>before java 1.5 version we can run a java program only with the help of static block</u>, but after that it is mandatory to write main method in our program to run the java application.
5. final static variables, we are supposed to initialize them at time of its declaration or only inside a static block . anywhere else if we are trying to initialize a final static variable except inside a static block or at the time of its declaration we will be getting an compile time error.
