1. up to java 1.4 version switch accepts only 4 datatypes (int, byte, short, char)
2. from java 1.5 version onwards switch started accepting their respective wrapper classes also (Integer, Byte, Short, Character)
3. from java 1.7 version onwards switch started accepting string also 
4. inside switch case we can write any no of case labels. if a case label got matched with the key value then from that case all the cases which were present inside the switch will be getting executed
5. in order to avoid this situation if we want only the case which got matched with key value to be executed then we need to use break statements <span style="color:red;">break statements</span> 
6. when ever the compiler came across the break statement the program will not be terminated, the compiler will just come out from the block 
7. if no case label is matching with the key value then we can write default case
8. default case will be getting executed only if no case label is matching with the key value irrespective of its position we can write default case anywhere inside the switch case statement
