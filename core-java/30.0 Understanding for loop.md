- it is not mandatory to write Initialize statement 
```java 
 int i = 10;
 int j = 5;
 for( ;i<5;i++,j--) {
 }
```

1. for loop consists of '3' statements, those are Initialization, test-condition, increment or decrement operator 
2. if we are writing for loop 100% we need to write 2 semicolons other wise we  will be getting compile time error 
3. Initialization statement will be executed only once in the for loop 
4. pre increment or post increment and pre decrement or post decrement will not have any impact on the output 
5. Initialization statement can be any valid java statement 
6. if we are not writing any condition then compiler will automatically consider the condition as true by default 
7. all the statements are optional in for loop
