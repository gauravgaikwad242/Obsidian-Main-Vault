#### Join

The join method allows the current executing thread to wait for the completion of another thread 

Every join method throws interrupted exception, hence compulsory we should handle either by try catch finally blocks or by using throws keyword. 
otherwise we will be getting an compile time exception

#### Sleep 
If we want a thread to pause performing any action for a given amount of time then we should use sleep method, this is an efficient means of making processor time available to the other threads of an application.

there are two versions of sleep method 
Thread.sleep(long millisecond,int nanosecond)
Thread.sleep(long millisecond)

However the sleep timings of thread are not guaranteed to be precise because they are highly system Dependent

#### Interrupt 
An interrupt is an indication to a thread that it should stop what it is doing and do something else 
for the interrupt mechanism to work correctly the interrupted thread must be in either sleeping state or in waiting state 
if the selected thread is sleep mode then interrupt method will wait until it went into sleeping mode and then it will cause interruption for that thread

#### Yield
yield method provides an mechanism to inform a thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to handover its current use of processor but it like to be scheduled back as soon as possible 

if we are using yield method then the seleated thread will give a chance to other threads with ***same priority*** to execute

if there are several waiting threads with same priority then we cant expect exactly which thread will get a chance for  its execution 

we cant expect when the yielded thread will make resume its execution
