#accessModifiers determine whether other classes can be used a particular field or invoke a particular method.

In java we are having 4 access Modifiers they provides access restrictions which will enhance the data security 

All these 4 access modifiers are classified into two levels 
1. CLASS LEVEL [public, default]
2. MEMBER LEVEL [public, private, protected, default]

|modifier|class|package|sub-class (Inheritance)|world|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|public|yes|yes|yes|yes|
|protected|yes|yes|yes||
|default|yes|yes|||
|private|yes||||

we cannot access a public method of a default class in another class present in another package
