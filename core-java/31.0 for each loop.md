- for each loop also know <u style="color:red" > enhanced for loop </u>
- for each loop has been introduced in java 1.5 version it acts as an alternative to for loop while retrieving the data from array and from collection classes 

Syntax : 
step 1. Declare variable that the same type as the base type of the array 
step 2. Write the colon (:)
step 3. Then write the array name 
step 4. in the loop body we have to use the variable which we have created 

```java 
int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
for(int i: arr) {

}
```


- if we want to retrieve the data from an array by using for loop we can retrieve the data both in forward and in reverse orders because for loop will be working on index positions 
- whenever we are retrieving the data from an array by using for each loop we can retrieve the data only in forward direction because for each loop will nob e working on index positions it works streaming data
