- variables are nothing but reserved memory location to store values
-  in java we are having three types of variables
1. instance variables 
2. static variables  
3. local variables

#### Instance Variables 
1. the variables which are declared inside a class, Outside any method or a block or a Constructor are known as Instance Variables 
2. We can access an instance variable in two ways, by using identifier name and by using class object 
3. for instance variables JVM will automatically initialize them with their `Default Values of the datatypes` 
4. if instance variable name and local variable name both are same then the first priority will be given to local variables
5. for every instance (Object) a separate copy of instance variable will be created. (means now many objects we are creating those many copies of instance variable will be created. ) 

#### Static Variable
1. These variables are declared inside a class, Outside any method or a block or a constructor and with the help of  `static` keyword 
2. static variables will be initialize at the time of class loading by the Class Loader 
3. We can access a static variable in three ways 
	1. by using identifier name
	2. by using class object 
	3. by using class name 
4. for static variables JVM will automatically initialize them with their default values of the datatypes 
5. if static variable and local variables are having same name then the first priority will be given to local variable
6. <u>*A static variable can never be a local variable*</u>
7.  *THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE COPY OF STATIC VARIABLE AVAILABLE IN THE ENTIRE PROGRAM* #interview 


#### Local Variable 
1. The variables which are declared inside a method or block or a constructor are know as local variables 
2. we can access a local variable only with the help of its identifier name.
3. the scope of a local variable is only within the method (means we cannot access a local variable outside the method.  )
4. for local variables JVM will not assign any default values, it is the responsibility of the programmer to initialize them 
5. if we are declaring the local variable and if we are not using that variable then our program will be executed normally, but if we are using the local variable without Initialization we will getting an compile time error
