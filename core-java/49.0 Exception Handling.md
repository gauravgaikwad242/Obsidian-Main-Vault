#### Exception vs Error 
- they are completely different
- Error : we cannot handle so program terminates 
- Exception : if we handle it the program continues

#### Error 
- ***If there is an error in our program, our program will be terminated, we cannot save our program. Errors can't be handled***

| . | Error | . |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Compile time Error** | **Runtime Error**  | **Logical Error**  |
| These error occurs due to wrong syntax (syntactica error) | these errors occurs due to inefficiency of machines | these Errors occurs due to bad logic by programmers  |
#### Exception 
***If there is an Exception in our program our program will be terminated. But we can save our program by handling those exceptions. EXCEPTIONS CAN BE HANDLED***

| . | Exception | . |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Checked Exception**  |  | **Un-checked Exception** |
| the Exceptions which are detected at compile time by java compiler are known as checked exception |  | The Exception which are detected at runtime by JVM are known as unchecked exception |
NOTE: 
1. An exception only occurs inside a method or inside a block 
2. An Exception only occurs during RUNTIME, but some are detected during compile time and some are detected during runtime
