- Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the task and reuse no of times 
- Thread pool contains a group of fixed sized threads 
- A thread from the thread pool is assigned a task by the service provider 
- After completion of the task the thread is again available in the thread pool 
- At any point at most threads will be in actively processing the task 
- If additional task are submitted when all the threads are in active state then they will wait in the queue until a thread is available 
- if any thread terminates due to a failure during execution prior to shutdown a new thread will take its place 
- The threads in the pool will exists until it is explicitly shutdown
