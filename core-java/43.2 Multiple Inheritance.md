Java does not support **Multiple Inheritance** through classes because of ambiguity problem but we can achieve this **Multiple Inheritance** in java through **Interfaces**

##### constructor does not participate in inheritance.

| ClassB {meth1()} |  | ClassA { meth1()} |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|  | ClassC extends ClassA,ClassB { here which method will be executed when classc tries to call meth1 classA or classB this is the problem with multiple inheritance} |  |
