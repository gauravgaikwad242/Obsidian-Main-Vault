- Java 8 has introduced a new DateTime API to overcome the below mentioned drawbacks of old DateTime API
1. poor design - in old date time api default date starts from 19 month starts from 1 day starts with 0
2. Handling the time zones - in old date time api programmers are supposed to write lengthy code to handle different time zones
3. not thread safe - java.util.date is not synchronized so programmers are suppose to handle inconsistent results which were obtained when mulitple threads are trying to access the api. 
- all these drawbacks are overcome by using new datetime api.
