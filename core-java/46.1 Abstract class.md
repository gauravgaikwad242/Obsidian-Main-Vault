### A class which is declared as abstract with abstract keyword is known as abstract class 

1.  inside an Abstract class we can write both normal methods and abstract methods 

2.  it is not mandatory to write atleast one abstract method inside an abstract class. 

3.  writing abstract methods inside an abstract class is always optional  

#### 4.  if we are writing an abstract method inside a normal class then 100% that class should be declared as abstract class, otherwise we will be getting an compile time error 

5. Inside an abstract class we can write main() method, constructor, normal methods, abstract methods including static methods also. 
6. Abstract class cant be instantiated means we cannot create an object for abstract class. 
7. if we are inheriting an abstract class then in the child class 100% we need to provide implementation (Method Body) for all the abstract methods which are present in the abstract class otherwise we will be getting an compile time error int the child class. 
8. If we are not overriding all the abstract methods present in the abstract class, then in the child class we will be getting an C.E. 
9. In the child class if dont want to provide implementation for the abstract methods present in the abstract class then we need to make our child class also an abstract.

```java 
public abstract class ClassA {
    abstract void meth1();

    abstract void msg(String s);

    void meth2() {
        System.out.println("meth2 called ");
    }

    static void meth3() {
        System.out.println("static meth3() called");
    }

    ClassA() {
        System.out.println("abstractt class constructor");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("class A main() called");
        // new ClassA(); //C.E because we cannot instantiate abstractt class
    }
}

class ClassB extends ClassA {
    @Override
    void meth1() {
        System.out.println("abstract method");
    }

    @Override
    void msg(String val) {
        System.out.println("val : " + val);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClassA aobj = new ClassB();
        aobj.meth1();
        aobj.meth2();
        aobj.msg("java is awesome");
    }
